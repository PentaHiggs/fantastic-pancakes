Machine vision / deep learning project aiming to at the very least to find and read data off of street signs in images, at best to be able to extract locational information off of video taken while driving!

## Synopsis

Project attempting to take real-time video input, identify locational cues (via signs at intersections) and from that
data determine current location. 

## Goals

This itself may prove too difficult a goal, so it is broken down into smaller goals
as follows:

1. Identifying bounding rectangles / shapes for signs
2. Reading data off of street signs accurately
3. Transforming text read off of street signs into likely locations on the map (most likely using the Google Maps API)
4. Extracting street sign and hence locational data from a video recorded while driving
5. Extract street sign and locational data in real time through video
